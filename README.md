This project was done as a final project for [Hug61B](https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/) taught by UC Berkeley's Josh Hug,

The main aim of this project was to design a world generation algorithm , put it in the context of a playable game and using software engineering principles for managing complexity that comes with working with building large projects.

World generation is done by [binary space partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning).
